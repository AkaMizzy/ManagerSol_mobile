## Database Schema Updates

### Declaration Table Enhancements

- **Added `latitude` field**: Decimal(10,7) for precise location coordinates
- **Added `longitude` field**: Decimal(10,7) for precise location coordinates

### Data Validation Rules
- **Date validation**: Declaration dates cannot be in the future
- **Coordinate validation**: Latitude must be between -90 and 90 degrees, longitude between -180 and 180 degrees
- **Company scoping**: All new fields respect company-level data access restrictions

## New API Endpoints

### Company Data Access
- **`GET /company-projects`**: Retrieves all projects accessible to the current user's company
- **`GET /company-users`**: Retrieves all users within the same company for assignment purposes

### Enhanced Declaration Management
- **Updated `POST /declarations`**: Now accepts and validates all new fields
- **Updated `PUT /declarations/:id`**: Supports updating all new fields with proper validation
- **Enhanced `GET /declarations`**: Returns enriched data including project titles and declarant names
- **Enhanced `GET /declarations/:id`**: Returns complete declaration details with photos and chat history
